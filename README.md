# Fingerprint Authentication Application

This application demonstrates how to implement fingerprint authentication in an Android app using Java and Kotlin in Android Studio.

## Features

- Fingerprint authentication: Users can authenticate using their fingerprints, providing a convenient and secure method for accessing the app.
- Kotlin and Java compatibility: The application is developed using a combination of Kotlin and Java languages to showcase compatibility between the two.

## Requirements

- Android Studio: Make sure you have the latest version of Android Studio installed on your machine.
- Android device: Ensure you have an Android device with a fingerprint sensor to test the application.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
https://github.com/AdityaNC2004/Fingerprint-Authentication-Application.git
```

2. Open the project in Android Studio.

3. Connect your Android device to your computer via USB and enable USB debugging.

4. Run the application on your device by clicking the 'Run' button in Android Studio.

## Usage

1. Launch the application on your Android device.

2. On the main screen, you will see the option to authenticate using your fingerprint.

3. Tap on the fingerprint icon to initiate the authentication process.

4. Place your registered fingerprint on the device's fingerprint sensor.

5. Upon successful authentication, you will be granted access to the application.
